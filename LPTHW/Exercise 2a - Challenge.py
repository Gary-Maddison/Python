# The text before = is called a variable. Think of it as a box with items inside.
# We have a box called cars with 10 items inside.
cars = 10
# This is a variable called drivers containing 5
drivers = 5
# Here we are pulling up the variables and taking the figure from cars away from drivers. Basically 10 - 5 = 5
print(cars - drivers)

# Python will not ignore the text after # as its contained within the string
print("In the UK, we call this a # sign.")

#This line will print to the screen
print("Statement 1")

# THis line will not print to the screen as we are using # before the code starts
# print("Statement 2")

# THis line will print to the screen however this text will not print # This is an inline comment
