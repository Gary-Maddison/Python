print(34) # This is a integer
print(type(34)) # Here the function type tells us what class we have

print(2.33) # This is a float 
print(type(2.33)) # This tells us we have a float class

print(10 + 22.33) # If you add an integer and a float python will give you a float
print(type(10 + 22.33)) # This is telling us we haver a float class

# Common Operators

# Addition +
# Subtraction -
# Multiplication *
# Division /
# Exponentional **
# Modulo %
# Integer Division //

print(10/2) # A division always returns back a float, even when dividing ints
print(2 ** 3) # This is 2 to the 3 power giving us 8
print(10 % 3) # Here we are using modulo so it gives us the remiander giving us 1
print(10 // 3) # This operation will round down the division giving us 3 instead of 3.333

# Order of Operations

# P - Parenthesis ()
# E - Exponents ** (So 2 to power of 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8)
# M - Multiplication *
# D - Division /
# A - Addition +
# S - Subtraction -
